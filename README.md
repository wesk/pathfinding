pathfinding
===========

simple breadth-first search algorithm over 2d binary occupancy grid

Setup:
* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake ..

Sample code within main.cpp should be fairly clear.

Instantiate a grid, set the start, goal, and obstacles. 
Instantiate a pathfinder, pass the grid into the pathfinder constructor.
call the findpath() method
